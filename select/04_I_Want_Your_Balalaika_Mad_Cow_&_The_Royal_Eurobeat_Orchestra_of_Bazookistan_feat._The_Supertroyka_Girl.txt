Underground
You go to spin me around
Feel the sound
In my desire, babe
Kiss me now
And push me up, pull me down
Bad girl, kill me, kiss me, stop me tonight

Come into the freedom, ahy - ahy - ahy
Dancing like a Russian
Baby, light my passion
Come into my kingdom, ahy - ahy - ahy
Dancing in the moonlight, walk into the night

Bazooka Balalaika
Casatchok ale ale
You are the greatest Troika
Russian girl, oh yeah - oh yeah
Bazooka Balalaika
Pugachoff ale ale
My baby, do Svidanija
Say goodbye and take a chance

I want your Balalaika
Russian girl ale ale
You're the greatest Troyka
Dasvidania ale ale
I want your Balalaika
Pugachoff ale ale
My baby, do Svidanija
Say goodbye and take a chance

Round 'N' round
You push me down to the sound
Up and down
With my desire, babe
Like a shot
Because the night is so hot
Bad girl, take my fire over the night
