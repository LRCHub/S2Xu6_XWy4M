Listen! I can hear,
Carried with the wind,
He's playing, sweet sound of Balalaika

They say "It can't be
Just fantasy
He will never come back again"

I'm waiting for him, because
He said "Oh Natasha, my darling
I'll love you forever, I swear
Wait till I come back to you"

Listen! Can't you hear?
Carried with the wind,
He came back playing Balalaika
